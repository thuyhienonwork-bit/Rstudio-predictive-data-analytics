# Rstudio predictive data analytics

This project follows this requirements:

# 1. Business Problem Identification

Clearly state the business problem: This should be concise and specific, highlighting the core issue you aim to address.
Elaborate on the problem: Provide context and explain how you identified this problem. Discuss its significance and potential impact on the business. Why is it important to solve this problem? What are the potential benefits of finding a solution?

# 2. Data Preprocessing

Discuss potential data issues: Explain how you handled potential data issues such as errors, outliers, and missing values. Justify your approach. For example, if you removed outliers, explain why and mention the proportion of data removed.

# 3. Analysis and Visualization

- Visualize data using ggplot2: Four insightful visualizations using the ggplot2 package in R. Focus on quality over quantity, leveraging advanced features like facet_wrap() to create compelling and informative visuals.
- Develop a predictive model: Identify the most relevant independent variables and develop a predictive model. Explore different iterations by including and excluding variables to improve accuracy.

# 4. Interpretation and Communication - Both in Report and Video Presentation:

Provide clear and concise interpretations: Explain the key findings from your analysis and visualizations.
Offer data-driven recommendations: Based on your analysis, provide specific and actionable recommendations to address the business problem. Clearly connect your recommendations to your findings and explain how they can help solve the problem.
